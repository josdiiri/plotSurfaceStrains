# plotSurfaceStrains

This code takes strain data produced from Abaqus and plots them on the surface of 3D models. 

The file CodeForPlottingSurfaceStrains contains all the code needed to produce the figures in the paper. The code is organized in three sections: 1) Load the data, 2) Plot surface strains from individual models, and 3) Plot surface strains from comparisons between models. Each section can be run independently.
